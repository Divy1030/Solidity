# 🤝 Crowdfunding Smart Contract (with Contributor Governance)

This Solidity-based crowdfunding smart contract enables a manager to create a campaign with a funding **target**, a **deadline**, and a **minimum contribution** amount. Contributors can fund the campaign, but the **manager cannot withdraw funds** unless at least **50% of contributors approve** the request.

## 🧠 How It Works

### 🧑‍💼 Manager (Deployer)
- Sets the **target amount**, **deadline**, and **minimum contribution**.
- Can create **payment requests** (where funds are intended to be used).
- **Cannot withdraw funds** without approval from contributors.

### 👥 Contributors
- Anyone can become a contributor by sending **at least the minimum contribution** before the deadline.
- Each valid contributor is **registered** and can:
  - Approve or reject spending requests made by the manager.

### 🔒 Governance
- For any **withdrawal request**, **50% or more contributors** must approve it.
- Ensures **decentralized fund control**, preventing misuse.
